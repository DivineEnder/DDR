NONE - NONE
Thor
I see that you are not just a follower of Bragi.
You are special. You have the courage of a follower of Thor and the footwork skills of a follower of Bragi.
You now have two favours, both mine and Bragi's you are two-thirds of a circle, but not yet full.
Go forth hero, and complete your quest of fullness.
You must now go to Loki and earn his favour in order to quench the thirst for war between our followers.
BE FOREWARNED!!! Loki is a trickster, one whose cleverness is exceeded only by his narcissistic tendencies.
He may make the dance more difficult for you, but always remember...
NEVER GIVE UP!
NEVER SURRENDER!
