NONE - NONE
Thor
I see that you are strong young padawan, but you still have much to learn.
You now have two favours, both mine and Bragi's you are two-thirds of a circle, but not yet full.
Go forth hero, and complete your quest of fullness.
You must now go to Loki and earn his favour in order to quench the thirst for war between our followers.
BE FOREWARNED!!! Loki is a trickster, one whose cleverness is exceeded only by his narcissistic tendencies.
He may make the dance more difficult for you, but always remember...
NEVER GIVE UP!
NEVER SURRENDER!
