NONE - NONE
Loki
You're on tricksy person. I guess you really do deserve to the hold Bragi's favor.
You have played my games well and so I will allow you to leave with your honor in tact.
...
Or I guess I could give you my favor and let you dance with the Allfather...
I think I will do that, you are such a small, insignifigant character in this plotline that he will easily squash you and your dancing skills.
Fine... I have decided to give my favor.
Have fun challenging ODIN theAllfather to a dance battle.
He should make quick work of a little pipsqueak like you!
BEGONE FOUL BEAST!
