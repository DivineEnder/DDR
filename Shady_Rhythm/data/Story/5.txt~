Pump Up The Jam Mixdown - Mowe
How did you get in here!
My guard let you in did he?
Why would he do that?
...
You danced him for it?
Why on earth....
Oh, you must be from Bragi
Tell Bragi that he is to stop his followers from attacking mine, I have done nothing to him
...
What!
He told you that my followers were attacking his!
What an a-hole!
Well I guess that we have to fix this.
Prove yoursefl to me and you can gain my favor to stop my followers from warring.
