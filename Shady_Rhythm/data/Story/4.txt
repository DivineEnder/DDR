Chopperhead - Two Steps From Hell
Guard
Hey, what are you doing here?
...
...
Here to see Thor huh?
WELL YOU CAN'T!
...
...
You're not going to leave are you? You're just going to sit there like a lost puppy until I kick you out, and I hate kicking puppies.
Fine, I will allow you one chance to prove that the essence of Thor resides within you.
Get ready for a dance off.
...
Already done a dance off huh?
WELL THIS IS DIFFERENT!
Thor himself gave me this power, and I will use it to make sure that your courage does not fail you.
If you are truely worthy of meeting with Thor you will find the courage within yourself to stand upon your own one foot and dance me right out from this doorway.
Let the dance battle Coooommmmmmeeeeennnnncccceeeeeeee!!!!!
