Bragi
Hello hero.
I am Bragi, God of Music and Dance, Lord of all things poetic.
I have selected you for a great task.
A great war has begun...
My followers, those who spread the love of music and dance, are under attack by Mr. Hammertime himself, Thor, and the trickster, Loki.
I have shielded those that bear my symbol as best I can, but I cannot directly intervene in the worldly affairs of mortals.
I have chosen you to go as my champion.
You must go to Thor and Loki and challenge them. Convince them that music and dance are more important than anything else in this world.
You must dance them out of this world.
But first you must prove yourself to me.
If more than 70% of your spirit is devoted to me, then you will be worthy.
Are you ready hero?
You better be...
Commence the dance off!
