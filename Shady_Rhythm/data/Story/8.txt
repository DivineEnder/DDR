Loki
Tricksy circles, always getting past my guards.
I am Loki lord of the riddle and player of many games.
What do you seek?
...
...
Thor sent you did he? And how is the courageous oaf? Is he still mad about that little prank?
...
...
You came to win my favour?
To stop my followers?
Well you will have to first best me in a battle of wits.
...
...
Oh, you dance do you, well I have just the surprise in store for you.
Thor may have made you stand your ground but you'll need quick footwork to defeat me.  
Let the battle of dancing wits COMMMMMEEEEENNNNNCCCCCEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!
